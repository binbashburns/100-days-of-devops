# Day 060: Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes

**Time**: 35 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus DevOps team is working on a Kubernetes template to deploy a web application on the cluster. There are some requirements to create/use persistent volumes to store the application code, and the template needs to be designed accordingly. Please find more details below:

Create a `PersistentVolume` named as `pv-nautilus`. Configure the `spec` as storage class should be `manual`, set capacity to `4Gi`, set access mode to `ReadWriteOnce`, volume type should be `hostPath` and set path to `/mnt/sysops` (this directory is already created, you might not be able to access it directly, so you need not to worry about it).

Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` named as `pvc-nautilus`. Configure the `spec` as storage class should be `manual`, request `1Gi` of the storage, set access mode to `ReadWriteOnce`.

Create a `pod` named as `pod-nautilus`, mount the persistent volume you created with claim name `pvc-nautilus` at document root of the web server, the container within the pod should be named as `container-nautilus` using image `httpd` with `latest` tag only (remember to mention the tag i.e `httpd:latest`).

Create a node port type service named `web-nautilus` using node port `30008` to expose the web server running within the pod.

## Technologies Used
- `vi`
- `kubectl`

## Steps

1. Because there are so many resources requested, I used kubernetes docs and created [this manifest](../configs/060-all-resources.yaml)

    ```bash
    # Create manifest
    thor@jumphost ~$ vi all.yaml
    ```

2. Spin it up

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ k apply -f all.yaml 
    persistentvolume/pv-nautilus created
    persistentvolumeclaim/pvc-nautilus created
    pod/pod-nautilus created
    service/web-nautilus created
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- This one took a while. Make sure you verify that labels and selectors match.
