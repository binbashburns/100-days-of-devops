# Day 003: Secure Root SSH Access

**Time**: 6 minutes

## Objective
Following security audits, the `xFusionCorp Industries` security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.

Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the `Stratos Datacenter`.

## Technologies Used
- SSH Config
- Least Privilege Access

## Steps

1. SSH to `App Server 01`

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh tony@stapp01
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$
    ```

2. Find where SSH config is stored because I'm a loser and forgot:

    ```bash
    # Use find to binary to find the directory
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ find / -iname ssh 2>/dev/null
    /etc/ssh

    # Verify the configuration is in sshd_config
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep RootLogin
    PermitRootLogin yes
    ```

3. Change the `PermitRootLogin` value to no, then restart the service:

    ```bash
    # Use find to binary to find the directory
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # (Edit change PermitRootLogin value "yes" to no", close and save changes)

    # Restart sshd
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

4. Repeat above steps for `stapp02` and `stapp03`

## Key Takeaways
- Don't be embarassed that you forgot where a very important directory is, use `find`. No shame.
