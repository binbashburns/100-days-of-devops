# Day 001: Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell

**Time**: 7 minutes

## Objective
To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at `xFusionCorp Industries` requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. Here's your task:

Create a user named `ravi` with a non-interactive shell on `App Server 1`.

## Technologies Used
- Linux built-in's

## Steps

1. SSH to App Server 1

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh tony@stapp01
    The authenticity of host 'stapp01 (172.16.238.10)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:zqTSxYATlhSH2jj9S2hZvGi2yhGPcKatjN5VnHtVOIY.
    This key is not known by any other names
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'stapp01' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
    tony@stapp01's password: 
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$
    ```

2. Review `/etc/passwd` to jog memory on non-interactive shell location (it was `/sbin/nologin`)

    ```bash
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo cat /etc/passwd
    ...
    bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
    ...
    ```

3. Review `useradd` syntax:

    ```bash
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ useradd --help
    Usage: useradd [options] LOGIN
           useradd -D
           useradd -D [options]

    Options:
    ...
    -s, --shell SHELL             login shell of the new account
    ...
    ```

4. Add user `ravi` and finish:

    ```bash
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin ravi
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Always check `help`, and don't be afraid to look at working examples
