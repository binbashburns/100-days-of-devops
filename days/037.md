# Day 037: Copy File to Docker Container

**Time**: 2 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on `App Server 2` in the `Stratos Datacenter`. A container named `ubuntu_latest` is running on the same server.

Copy an encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg` from the docker host to the `ubuntu_latest` container located at `/usr/src/`. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

## Technologies Used
- `ssh`
- `docker`

## Steps

1. SSH into `stapp02` server

    ```bash
    # SSH to stapp02
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh steve@stapp02
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ 
    ```

2. Copy file from docker host to the container

    ```bash
    # Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg to /usr/src on ubuntu_latest
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ sudo docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src
    # Successfully copied 2.05kB to ubuntu_latest:/usr/src
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Use Docker docs (specifically the examples toward the bottom) to help: https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/cp/
