# Day 034: Git Hook

**Time**: 15 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/opt/beta.git` which is cloned under `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` directory present on `Storage server` in `Stratos DC`. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:

Merge the `feature` branch into the `master` branch, but before pushing your changes complete below point.

Create a `post-update` hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the `master` branch, it creates a release tag with name `release-2023-06-15`, where `2023-06-15` is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is `20th June, 2023` then the release tag must be `release-2023-06-20`. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.

Finally remember to push your changes.
Note: Perform this task using the `natasha` user, and ensure the repository or existing directory permissions are not altered.
