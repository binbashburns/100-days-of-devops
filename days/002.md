# Day 002: Temporary User Setup with Expiry

**Time**: 6 minutes

## Objective
Create a user named `javed` on `App Server 2` in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to `2024-03-28`, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

## Technologies Used
- `useradd`

## Steps

1. SSH to App Server 2

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh steve@stapp02
    ...
    steve@stapp02's password: 
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ 
    ```

2. Look at `useradd` syntax for expiration dates

    ```bash
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ useradd -h | grep expir*
    -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE  expiration date of the new account
    ```

3. Create user and verify it was created:

    ```bash
    # Create user
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ sudo useradd -e 2024-03-28 javed

    # Verify is was created
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ cat /etc/passwd | grep javed
    javed:x:1002:1002::/home/javed:/bin/bash
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Always rely on help menu if you don't know syntax
