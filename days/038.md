# Day 038: Pull Docker Image

**Time**: 5 minutes

## Objective
Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task:
- Pull `busybox:musl` image on `App Server 1` in `Stratos DC` and re-tag (create new tag) this image as `busybox:blog`.

## Technologies Used
- `ssh`
- `docker`

## Steps

1. SSH into `stapp01` server

    ```bash
    # SSH to stapp01
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh tony@stapp01
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ 
    ```

2. Pull image, tag it

    ```bash
    # Pull busybox:musl
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker pull busybox:musl

    # tag it with busybox:blog
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker tag busybox:musl busybox:blog
    ```

3. Verify the image was tagged correctly

    ```bash
    # Run docker help to understand syntax of listing images
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker --help
    # look for image list command

    # Check images to verify the tag was created
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker image ls
    # REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
    # busybox      blog      1e2006b46d8b   15 months ago   1.51MB
    # busybox      musl      1e2006b46d8b   15 months ago   1.51MB
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Use `docker help` if you don't know the command syntax for something
