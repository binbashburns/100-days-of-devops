# Day 042: Create a Docker Network

**Time**: 5 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

- Create a docker network named as `beta` on `App Server 3` in `Stratos DC`.

- Configure it to use `bridge` drivers.

- Set it to use subnet `192.168.0.0/24` and iprange `192.168.0.0/24`.

## Technologies Used
- `ssh`
- `docker`

## Steps

1. SSH into `stapp03` server

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
    
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$
    ```

2. Review docker network create syntax in Docker documentation

    ```bash
    # Link used:
    https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/network/create/
    ```

3. Create network using example on website

    ```bash
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ docker network create \
    --driver=bridge \
    --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 \
    --ip-range=192.168.0.0/24 \
    beta

    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Use vendor documentation! A lot of times they have exactly the example you need / want
