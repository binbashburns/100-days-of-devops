# Day 044: Write a Docker Compose File

**Time**: 10 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the `httpd` web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

- On `App Server 1` in `Stratos DC` create a container named `httpd` using a docker compose file `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` (please use the exact name for file).

- Use `httpd` (preferably `latest` tag) image for container and make sure container is named as `httpd`; you can use any name for service.

- Map `80` number port of container with port 8086 of docker host.

- Map container's `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` volume with `/opt/finance` volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

## Technologies Used
- `ssh`
- `vi`
- `docker`

## Steps

1. SSH into `stapp01` server

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$  ssh tony@stapp01
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$
    ```

2. Create `docker compose` file with requested specifications

    ```bash
    # Create file
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo vi /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml

    # Print contents so you, the reader, can see what I used:
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo cat /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml
    services:
    httpd:
        image: httpd:latest
        container_name: httpd
        ports:
        - 8086:80
        volumes:
        - /opt/finance/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
    ```

3. `docker compose up` to create container using the newly created file

    ```bash
    # Change into the correct directory
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ cd /opt/docker/

    # Spin it up
    [tony@stapp01 docker]$ docker compose up
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Look up examples that you have used in the past or other people's examples if you get stuck on syntax.
