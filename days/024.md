# Day 024: Git Create Branches

**Time**: 4 minutes

## Objective
Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps`. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

- On `Storage server` in Stratos DC create a new branch `xfusioncorp_apps` from master branch in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` git repo.

- Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

## Technologies Used
- `git`
- `ssh`

## Steps

1. SSH into `ststor01` server

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$
    ```

2. Change directories into `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps`

    ```bash
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
    ```

3. Move to master, checkout new branch

    ```bash
    # Switch to master branch, had to use sudo because the repository is in a nonsensical directory
    [natasha@ststor01 apps]$ sudo git checkout master
    # Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

    # Create new branch
    [natasha@ststor01 apps]$ sudo git checkout -b xfusioncorp_apps
    # Switched to a new branch 'xfusioncorp_apps'

    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Again, relatively straightforward task
