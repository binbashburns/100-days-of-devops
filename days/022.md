**Time**: 15 minutes

## Objective

    ```bash
    # SSH to storage server
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ 
    ```

2. Clone `/opt/news.git` to `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos`

    ```bash
    # Move into destination directory
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/

    # Clone repository
    [natasha@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]$ git clone /opt/news.git
    # Cloning into 'news'...
