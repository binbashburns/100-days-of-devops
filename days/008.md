# Day 008: Install Ansible


**Time**: 4 minutes

## Objective
- Install `ansible` version `4.9.0` on `Jump host` using `pip3` only. 
- Make sure Ansible binary is available globally on this system, i.e all users on this system are able to run Ansible commands.

## Technologies Used
- `pip3`

## Steps

1. Exact guidance on installing a pinned version of Ansible using `pip3` is [in their docs](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#pip-install). We're going to modify it a bit though and drop the `--user` flag as well as run as `sudo`

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ sudo python3 -m pip install ansible==4.9.0

    We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
    Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
        #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
