# Day 046: Deploy an App on Docker Containers

**Time**: 20 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform. The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment. The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. Below are the details of the task:

On `App Server 3` in `Stratos Datacenter` create a docker compose file `/opt/dba/docker-compose.yml` (should be named exactly).

The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below:

`For web service`:

a. Container name must be `php_apache`.

b. Use image `php` with any `apache` tag. Check [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/php?tab=tags/) for more details.

c. Map `php_apache` container's port 80 with host port 3002

d. Map `php_apache` container's `/var/www/html` volume with host volume `/var/www/html`.

`For DB service`:

a. Container name must be `mysql_apache`.

b. Use image `mariadb` with any tag (preferably `latest`). Check [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb?tab=tags/) for more details.

c. Map `mysql_apache` container's port `3306` with host port `3306`

d. Map `mysql_apache` container's `/var/lib/mysql` volume with host volume `/var/lib/mysql`.

e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=`database_apache` and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections.

After running docker-compose up you can access the app with curl command `curl <server-ip or hostname>:3002/`

For more details check [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb?tab=description/).

`Note`: Once you click on `FINISH` button, all currently running/stopped containers will be destroyed and stack will be deployed again using your compose file.

## Technologies Used
- `ssh`
- `vi`
- `docker`
- `curl`

## Steps

1. SSH into `stapp03` server

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
    ```

2. On `stapp03`, create a `docker-compose` file with the required settings

    ```bash
    # Create file
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo vi /opt/dba/docker-compose.yml

    # This is the contents of the file for my lab
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ cat /opt/dba/docker-compose.yml 
    
    services:
    web:
        image: php:apache
        container_name: php_apache
        ports:
        - 3002:80
        volumes:
        - /var/www/html:/var/www/html
    db:
        image: mariadb:latest
        container_name: mysql_apache
        ports:
        - 3306:3306
        volumes:
        - /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
        environment:
        - MARIADB_DATABASE=database_apache
        - MARIADB_USER=exampleuser
        - MARIADB_PASSWORD=examplepassword
        - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=examplerootpassword
    ```

3. Start the docker compose process

    ```bash
    # Change into the appropriate directory
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ cd /opt/dba/

    # Docker compose up
    [banner@stapp03 dba]$ sudo docker compose up
    ```

4. Open a new terminal tab, attempt to `curl`

    ```bash
    thor@jumphost ~$ curl stapp03:3002

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!</title>
        </head>

        <body>
            Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!    </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Look up example `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose` files if you get stuck
