# Day 027: Git Revert Some Changes

**Time**: 2 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` present on `Storage server` in `Stratos DC`. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo `HEAD` to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

- In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` git repository, revert the latest commit ( `HEAD` ) to the previous commit.

- Use `revert apps` message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

## Technologies Used
- `git`
- `ssh`
- `vi`


## Steps

1. SSH into ststor01 server, move to the git directory

    ```bash
    # SSH
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$

    # Change into the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps directory
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
    ```

2. View `git log`, revert to previous commit

    ```bash
    # View git log
    [natasha@ststor01 apps]$ sudo git log
    # commit 70c3013b384a58c595ec0de1fb66491b2176c881 (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
    # Author: Admin <admin@kodekloud.com>
    # Date:   Tue Dec 16 11:31:11 2025 +0000
    #     add data.txt file
    # commit d18787f3c78515730e838a154634f13f2698072b
    # Author: Admin <admin@kodekloud.com>
    # Date:   Tue Dec 16 11:31:11 2025 +0000
    #     initial commit

    # Revert
    [natasha@ststor01 apps]$ sudo git revert HEAD

    # On the window that pops up, set it to something like this:
    revert apps
    This reverts commit 70c3013b384a58c595ec0de1fb66491b2176c881.
    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
    #
    # On branch master
    # Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
    #
    # Changes to be committed:
    #       new file:   info.txt
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #       apps.txt
    #
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Always good to know how to use text editors like VI or nano; whichever is the default builtin editor
