# Day 057: Print Environment Variables

**Time**: 7 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

Create a `pod` named `print-envars-greeting`.

Configure spec as, the container name should be `print-env-container` and use `bash` image.

Create three environment variables:

a. `GREETING` and its value should be `Welcome to`

b. `COMPANY` and its value should be `Stratos`

c. `GROUP` and its value should be `Industries`

Use command `["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"']` (please use this exact command), also set its `restartPolicy` policy to `Never` to avoid crash loop back.

You can check the output using `kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting` command.

## Technologies Used
- `kubectl`
- `vi`

## Steps

1. Create the pod yaml (example is [here](../configs/057-pod.yaml))

    ```bash
    # create file
    thor@jumphost ~$ vi pod.yaml

    # print what I made so you can see
    thor@jumphost ~$ cat pod.yaml 

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: print-envars-greeting
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: print-env-container
        image: bash
        env:
        - name: GREETING
          value: "Welcome to"
        - name: COMPANY
          value: "Stratos"
        - name: GROUP
          value: "Industries"
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"']
    ```

2. Apply the manifest and test

    ```bash
    # Apply the manifest
    thor@jumphost ~$ k apply -f pod.yaml 
    # pod/print-envars-greeting created

    # and test
    thor@jumphost ~$ kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting
    # Welcome to Stratos Industries
    ```
