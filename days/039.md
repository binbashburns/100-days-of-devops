# Day 039: Create a Docker Image From Container

**Time**: 5 minutes

## Objective
One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:

- Create an image `ecommerce:xfusion` on `Application Server 3` from a container `ubuntu_latest` that is running on same server.

## Technologies Used
- `ssh`
- `docker`

## Steps

1. SSH into `stapp03` server, look at running containers to grab hash

    ```bash
    # SSH to stapp03
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ 

    # look at running containers
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
    d3068f525999   ubuntu    "/bin/bash"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes             ubuntu_latest
    ```

2. Research the appropriate docker command, run it, verify changes were made as intended

    ```bash
    # Research docker commit syntax, observe examples:
    # https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/commit/

    # commit
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ docker commit d3068f525999 ecommerce:xfusion
    # sha256:13b2335299b57355bbf4901312b8ee044e9c387723ebcc918cdf03f49a5037c7

    # Verify the image saved
    [banner@stapp03 ~]$ docker image list
    # REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    # ecommerce    xfusion   13b2335299b5   19 seconds ago   135MB
    # ubuntu       latest    c3a134f2ace4   2 months ago     78.1MB
    ```

## Key Takeaways
- Lean on vendor docs for support, use examples section
