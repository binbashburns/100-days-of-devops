# Day 032: Git Rebase

**Time**: 15 minutes

## Objective
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository `/opt/news.git`. This repo is cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` on `storage server` in `Stratos DC`. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

One of the developers is working on `feature` branch and their work is still in progress, however there are some changes which have been pushed into the `master` branch, the developer now wants to `rebase` the `feature` branch with the `master` branch without loosing any data from the `feature` branch, also they don't want to add any `merge commit` by simply merging the `master` branch into the `feature` branch. Accomplish this task as per requirements mentioned.

## Technologies Used
- `git`
- `ssh`

## Steps

1. SSH into `ststor01` server, change to the correct directory

    ```bash
    # SSH to ststor01
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ 

    # cd into the git repository
    [natasha@ststor01 ~]$ cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
    ```

2. Figure out which branch we're on, then rebase to master

    ```bash
    # look at existing branches
    [natasha@ststor01 news]$ sudo git branch
    # * feature
    # master

    # we are on feature, so lets rebase to master
    [natasha@ststor01 news]$ sudo git rebase master
    # Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/feature.
    ```

3. Push, setting upstream as feature

    ```bash
    # now we will force push, setting the upstream as feature
    [natasha@ststor01 news]$ sudo git push --force --set-upstream origin feature
    # Enumerating objects: 4, done.
    # Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    # Delta compression using up to 16 threads
    # Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    # Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 297 bytes | 297.00 KiB/s, done.
    # Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
    # To /opt/news.git
    # + 2cf0f6b...315adb1 feature -> feature (forced update)
    # branch 'feature' set up to track 'origin/feature'.
    ```
