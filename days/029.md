# Day 029: Manage Git Pull Requests

**Time**: 10 minutes

## Objective
`Max` want to push some new changes to one of the repositories but we don't want people to push directly to `master` branch, since that would be the final version of the code. It should always only have content that has been reviewed and approved. We cannot just allow everyone to directly push to the master branch. So, let's do it the right way as discussed below:

1. SSH into the storage server as `max`:`Max_pass123`

2.	Locate the already cloned repository in Max’s home directory.

3.	Verify the repository contents and commit history with `git log`. Confirm existing stories, authors, and commit messages.

4.	Note that Max’s changes are already pushed to the remote branch `story/fox-and-grapes`.

5.	Open the `Gitea UI` and log in as max.

6.	Create a pull request:
	-	Title: `Added fox-and-grapes story`
	-	Source branch: `story/fox-and-grapes`
	-	Target branch: `master`

7.	Add `tom` as a reviewer on the PR.

8.	Log out of Gitea.

9.	Log back into Gitea as `tom`:`Tom_pass123`

10.	Review the PR titled `Added fox-and-grapes story` and merge it into master.

## Technologies Used
- `gitea`
- `git`
- `ssh`

## Steps

1. SSH into `ststor01` server, locate the already cloned repository in Max’s home directory, verify the repository contents and commit history with `git log`.

    ```bash
    # SSH
    thor@jumphost ~$ ssh max@ststor01
    # Welcome to xFusionCorp Storage server.
    max $

    # locate the already cloned repository in Max’s home directory, verify the repository contents and commit history with git log
    max $ ls
    # story-blog
    
    max $ cd story-blog/
    
    # Check git log
    max (story/fox-and-grapes)$ git log
